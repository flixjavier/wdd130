    <h2>Felix Javier Flores Zamarripa</h2>
    <h2>Flix</h2>
    <p>My name is Felix, and I'm from the Mexican state of Chihuahua, which is close to El Paso, Texas. I consider myself to be a laid-back individual that enjoys conversing with people from all walks of life.</p>   
    <p>I'm the husband of a great wife and the parent of two young daughters (5 and 2). We enjoy spending time together as a family, especially on weekends. </p>
    <p>I already have a master's degree in biotechnology and a bachelor's degree in clinical chemistry. These degrees enabled me to work as a forensic scientist in the field of genetics for five years in Mexico. I come into contact with a lot of software during my time at school and at work, and I've felt inclined to learn programming since then.</p>
    <p>I currently work in sales, but I hope to have the opportunity to teach in the future. Video gaming, reading, and anime are some of my favorite pastimes.</p>
