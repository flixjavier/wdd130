      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Biology and science have attracted my attention since I can remember. 
        I'm a chemist with a master's degree in biotechnology and I am working 
        on a certificate in computer programming under my belt. I'm fascinated 
        with technology and keen to master new abilities.
        Video games, science, and technology are all things that I enjoy. 
        Meeting new people and learning new things are two of my favorite things to do. 
        Welcome to my site, where you may discover more about myself and my daily activities.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This is the place for those who prefer simple yet interesting technology talks, 
          as well as those who enjoy learning and teaching new topics. 
          Come along with me on this never-ending adventure of discovery.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        I'm excited you came to visit my small corner of the internet.
        The Flixjavier Blog was launched in 2022 as a tool to highlight the coolest
        and most simple ways to learn science and programming. This website would open 
        up a whole new world for you and make your life more entertaining.
        Over the years, I've gained experience and knowledge in subjects such as biology, 
        genetics, and, more recently, computer programming. And I'd want to give you a very 
        basic introduction to these topics.
        Welcome to the site! Please take a look around.

      <h3>Something about Biology</h3>
      <p>
        Come here to get quick answers to science-related questions (biology, genetics). 
        Your question will be answered in a simple manner that anyone (with or without a 
        scientific background) can understand. This site will teach you about the fascinating 
        world of biology, as well as all other things relevant to it. Join me on this new journey.

      <h3>Programming is all Relative</h3>
      <p>
        Coding is fun!
        There's nothing like the feeling of your fingers flying over a keyboard, and seeing 
        the results of your hard work come to life. Coding is an amazing way to make something 
        out of nothing, and it's never too late to learn how.
